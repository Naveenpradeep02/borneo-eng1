            Manhood is such a sensitive thing for any man since the evolution of
            human beings. The concept of survival of fittest has held good in
            all the eras irrespective who reigned the lands. But this very
            manhood has been posed with a serious threat. Life style in general
            with no set biological clock, adulteration, synthetic colors,
            chemical flavors, increased use of pesticides, preservatives,
            aerated drinks, ready to eat foods, tobacco, alcohol, poultry from
            broilers, pollution. In fact, the list can never be exhaustive which
            has caused a variety of health issues. One of these is sexual heath
            which is not openly discussed and accepted but it happens to be the
            most important aspect of human evolution. Besides the pleasure
            aspect, progeny is slowly and steadily becoming a challenge. There
            are fertility centers that are charging a bomb for IVF, artificial
            insemination and test tube babies.

            The most common health issues include Erectile Dysfunction (ED),
            Premature Ejaculation (PE), reduced stiffness, lack of libido, lack
            of fertility, low sperm count, poor quality of sperm and general
            fatigue. Women are just passive partners when it comes to love
            sports and men end up under performing to alarming levels that there
            is a steep increase in divorce cases. Over and above these physical
            aspects, it creates inferiority complex and a gamut of psychological
            mind blocks arising thereof.
